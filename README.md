Avoidance
Resistance
  Complement/antimicrobial proteins
  Innate Immune
  Adaptive Immunity
Tolerance
  Our immune systems doing nothing when there is no threat
Lymphoid lineage
  lymphocyte
    Late responders - specific adaptations to pathogenic encounters
Myeloid Lineage
  Mast-cell Basophil/Eosiniphil Neutrophil Macrophage-Monocyte Dendritic-Cell
    Initial Responders non-specific responders to pathogenic encounters
Immune cells stay moving
  Move via blood lymph (crawling
  Home/tissues/organs - Bone marrow, Thymus, Lymph nodes, and Spleen
Similar to Super heroes
  Innate immune "sensor" cells will sense threats through Pattern Recognition Receptors
  Communicate to phagocytes to come over here via communicatory molecules (chemokines/cytokines) Recruit
    Dendritic cells bridge the communication barrier between innate and adaptive immunity
